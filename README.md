# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown
Made a dashboard using Power BI
1) Used Power Query Editor to clean data
2) Deleted columns that had null values
3) Split columns by delimter, made it so theres less categories per column
4) Split columns by digit to non-digit
5) Replaced values "k","-" with blanks to have the end range of salary number
6) Created custom column to find the average salary
7) It gave error at first, so I changed columns from text into number

Started a dashboard
1) Created text box to make a title
2) Used the "card" visualization to display total number of survey participants and the average age
3) Created a "stacked column chart" to display favorite programming language based on job title
4) Created a "donut chart" to display difficulty to break into the data field
5) Created two "guage charts" to display happiness with salary and happiness with work/life balance
6) Created "tree map" to display country of survey participants
7) Created "stacked bar chart" to display average salary by job title
